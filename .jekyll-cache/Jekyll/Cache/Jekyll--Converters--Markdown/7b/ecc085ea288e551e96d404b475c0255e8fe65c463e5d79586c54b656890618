I"<p>Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years ago–<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing

and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>

<p>I have added a new blog post and I’m changing the content as part
of an exercise for section 8.</p>
